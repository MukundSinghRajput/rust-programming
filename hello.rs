fn main() {
    println!("Hello")
}

// This is the main() function which acts as an entry point of every Rust program. It is always the first code that runs in every Rust program.
// The body of the function is wrapped inside curly brackets, {}. We will learn more about functions in later chapters.

/*
print!() -->  Macro print's everything in the quote but won't give line break
Example:
        fn main() {
            print!("Rust is fun! ");
            print!("I love Rust programming.");
        }

    Output: Rust is fun! I love Rust programming.

    So println!() is used
